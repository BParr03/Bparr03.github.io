<h1>About me</h1>

<br>

<div class="aboutme">
    <p>I am currently in my third year at the University of Huddersfield studying Information Technology, I am also currently on placement at the Boohoo Group for the 2023/24 academic year as a React/NodeJS Developer. I am originally from Nottinghamshire but living in Huddersfield for university. 
    </p>
    <p>Web programming has become a passion of mine that in recently recent years but quickly became a career path I wanted to pursue. I have had an interest in programming for years using languages like Python, however they did not fully appeal to me like web programming has. I am always learning something new developing websites which further propels my enjoyment in the process.
    </p>
    <p>My other interests are playing video games, which have been a massive hobby of mine for most of my life. I also go to the gym regularly as I have began focusing on improving my self and my health over the past year by staying active. I also enjoy going out with friends to socialise and having a laugh. Furthermore, I also watch a lot of tech youtubers as I am interested in the new technology that seems to be appearing more and more frequently and how technology is evolving rapidly as a whole.
